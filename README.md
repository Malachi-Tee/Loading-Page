# Loading Page Project
A simple project to test out a custom loading page. 

## How It's Made:
**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
**HTML** is used to display a static webpage as well as an overlay page blocking the inital.
**CSS** is used for styling the page. It is also responsible for the animation on the loading page. 
**Javascript** is used for the pages clickable functionality. It allows the loading page to be hidden and removed. 

## Lessons Learned:

Ive learned about the power of css when using it to add to the responsiveness and engagement on a webpage and coupled with simple javascript functions can leave you with very good results. 

## Optimizations

The idea of the loading page is to engage with the user and not block them from content but it could be made in a way so that even with DOM manipulation of the page you still couldn't view the next page. This would be useful in cases of authorization.
